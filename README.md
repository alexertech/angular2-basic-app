### Key information about Angular2

An Angular2 app have 4 key players:

 - Components
 - Directives
 - Routers
 - Services

+ A component, encapsulate the template, data and the behavior of a view (view component).

Every angular app have a root component at least. Just as example, a component can be a navigation bar, sidebar, and main. Also they can contain multiple components.

Can be written as a simple classic object:
```
 export class ObjectComponent {
  attribute: number;
  method (value) {

  }
 }
```
One interesting thing to have in mind is that a component can't access directly to the DOM, so for that we must use a "bind":
```
  title = "Howdy"  -------->> <h1>howdy</h1>
```
The best thing about components is that they can be unit tested.

+ Services are the objects that can talk with thins like the DB (Mongo), Node or Whatever.

+ Routers are responsible for navigation

+ Directives is the piece of code that can talk with the DOM and add behavior. For example, a directive can add something like an autoGrow to a input element, and are a nice way to add personalization.
